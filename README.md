# Mod that makes Rift Wizard game scale non-pixel-perfectly, but taking maximum from available space

## Installation
01. [Download zip](https://github.com/apollovy/rift-wizard-mod-scale/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
0. Extract it to your game's *mods* directory (typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rift Wizard\RiftWizard\mods`).
0. Rename mod directory into `ScaleMod` -- this is necessary for the game to treat this mod as actual mod.
0. (Re)start the game to get it scaled!
